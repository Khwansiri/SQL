This repository is part of software engineer evaluation of Data ScienTech Institute.  
The main purpose is to replicate SQL functions, stored procedures and triggers, for dynamic survey in python as we are in the situation where we have no privileges to create those functions in SQL server directly.  


## Objective:   
1. Connect to SQL database server using python  
2. Create stored procudure function for dynamic SQL survey  
3. Create trigger function for creating/altering the view whenever there is some update in dynamic survey structure.
